There are 645 java files. The first 61 files in descending order of size contain 50% of the total lines of code.
The total LOC is 159,429.	

The following are my notes for each file, starting from the largest file and working my way down.

./src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/client/character/Char.java

This file defines the database table which stores the information for all characters in the server. 
It has a few functions which implement sending packets of information to and from the server about characters, 
such as which items are in the character's inventory, and what they have equipped. 
It can also set skills, levels, attributes, and jobs. 

./src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/scripts/ScriptManagerImpl.java

The implements and manages python scripts which can be used while the server is running to set skill levels, 
stats, send messages, spawn mobs, and so on. 

./src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/constants/ItemConstants.java

All of the items in the game have numeric IDs, this file has helpers to get the IDs from the name or type of the item.
It can also get properties such as the type of item from the ID. This file doesn't do anything complex, it mostly
has lots of boolean functions which ask questions like "is the item with ID number 104592645 a gun?"

./src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/client/character/commands/AdminCommands.java

As the name suggests, this file implements all of the Admin Commands. 

./src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/constants/SkillConstants.java

This is the same type of file as ItemConstants, but for skills. 

./src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/life/mob/Mob.java

This implements mob behavior, as well as broadcasting packets to and from the server about mob stats such as damage.
This keeps track of mob activity and makes sure the info is synchonized between the clients and the server.

./src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/handlers/header/OutHeader.java

This is an enum, which means it is just a gigantic list of names and values. These are presumably for transmission of packets
of data out from the server. 

./src/main/java/net/swordie/ms/client/character/items/Equip.java

This defines a database table for Equips. In this table it should store basically all the data necessary for equips so their
basic stats and effects can be referenced and things like that.
